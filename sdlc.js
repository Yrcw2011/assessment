const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = "Decide on how this can be accomplished using the tools we have and what will be required."
const Design = "Creating the big picture of what this will do."
const Code = "Write the code that is needed to operate the finished design."
